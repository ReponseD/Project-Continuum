# Project Continuum

### Building Africaâ€™s Independent Robotics & Engineering Ecosystem for the 22nd Century

---

## Introduction
Project Continuum is an **African-led initiative** to create a self-sustaining robotics and technology ecosystem. Our goal is to empower students to innovate, build, and compete **without reliance on expensive imported kits or foreign programs**.  

Project Continuum is not just a robotics programâ€”it is a **movement** preparing Africa for the next century of innovation.

## The Story Behind Project Continuum
We began as a **FIRST LEGO League (FLL) team** supported by the Rwanda Basic Education Board. For many students, it was the first time ever seeing and interacting with a LEGO robot, unlocking imagination, problem-solving, and teamwork.  

After graduation, we faced barriers:
- **FTC kits cost over $5,000 USD** (excluding shipping).  
- Most families lived on **less than $1/day**.  
- Attempts to ship donated kits from the U.S. resulted in only 4 out of 21 kits arriving.  
- **FRC competitions** were completely out of reach financially and logistically.  

Despite starting an international African FRC team and qualifying for competitions, we could not raise sufficient funds to travel and compete.  

These challenges gave birth to **Project Continuum**: an ecosystem that Africa controls, builds, and sustains independently.

## Why Project Continuum Matters
1. **Accessibility** â€“ No student should be excluded from robotics and engineering due to cost.  
2. **Independence** â€“ Africa must create its own technology platforms and ecosystems.  
3. **Continuity** â€“ A complete pipeline from beginner robotics to advanced AI and engineering.  
4. **Future-Readiness** â€“ Equipping Africaâ€™s youth to lead global innovation by 2100.

## Our Mission
Project Continuum builds an **independent African ecosystem for robotics and advanced technology**, combining:
- **Affordable, locally manufacturable kits** for schools and students.  
- **Curriculum and training programs** to teach problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills.  
- **Competitions and challenges** that are accessible, inclusive, and scalable.  
- **Startup incubation pathways** linking student innovation to commercial ventures.  

---

## How We Work
- **Design & Manufacturing** â€“ Open-source hardware and software kits produced locally.  
- **Education & Training** â€“ Step-by-step programs, mentorship, and hands-on learning.  
- **Competitions & Challenges** â€“ Structured to inspire creativity, innovation, and teamwork.  
- **Incubation & Entrepreneurship** â€“ Students transition from learning to launching startups.  
- **Community Collaboration** â€“ Engineers, educators, students, and partners co-develop the ecosystem.

## Vision for 2100
By the end of this century, Africa will no longer be a consumer of technologyâ€”it will be a **global leader in robotics, AI, and engineering innovation**.  

Project Continuum ensures that todayâ€™s African students grow into tomorrowâ€™s leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators, creating a sustainable ecosystem that spans education, industry, and research.
