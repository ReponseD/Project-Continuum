# Project Continuum – Strategic Plan

## Transforming Africa’s Communities into Knowledge Societies for the 22nd Century

---

## **1. Why We Exist**

Project Continuum is **not ordinary technology education**. It is a **revolution** designed to empower African youth, especially those from underprivileged communities, to thrive in the next century.  

For decades, talented students faced barriers: high-cost robotics kits, inaccessible global competitions, and a lack of local mentorship. Many brilliant minds never had the chance to experiment, innovate, or lead in technology.  

We saw the spark when children first interacted with Lego robots. Their curiosity revealed untapped potential—but the pathway beyond that moment was blocked. That is why Project Continuum exists: to **create an independent African ecosystem** where youth can learn, innovate, and build the future on their own terms.
