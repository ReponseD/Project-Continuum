Project Continuum Roadmap
Vision

Empower African students with hands-on experience in robotics, AI, and technology innovation through accessible tools, mentorship, and community.

Phase 1: Foundation (0–3 months)

Goal: Build core infrastructure, community, and pilot framework.

Key Actions

Hardware

Finalize low-cost, modular robot kit designs suitable for local fabrication.

Document designs in CAD and schematic formats.

Create a preliminary Bill of Materials (BOM) with locally available components.

Software

Launch basic firmware and control software on GitHub.

Include simple simulator environment for safe testing.

Write documentation for installation and usage.

Community

Set up GitHub directories: ideas, events, outreach, media.

Establish communication channels (WhatsApp, Discord, or Telegram) for contributors.

Recruit initial student volunteers for feedback and testing.

Documentation

Publish strategic-plan.md, FAQ, and Code of Conduct.

Prepare a one-page overview for partner schools and sponsors.

Outputs

Functional prototype design and BOM.

Initial GitHub repository with software, simulator, and docs.

Small network of early student contributors.

Phase 2: Pilot Programs (3–9 months)

Goal: Test kits and software with real students, gather feedback, and refine the ecosystem.

Key Actions

Hardware Testing

Produce 10–20 pilot kits using local resources.

Test kits in 3–5 partner schools for usability and durability.

Software Training

Run introductory workshops (online or in-person) for teachers and students.

Train student volunteers to help peers use the kits and simulator.

Community Engagement

Collect feedback through surveys and group discussions.

Encourage students to submit project ideas via GitHub or community platform.

Events

Organize first small-scale hackathon or robotics challenge.

Document results and share student stories online.

Outputs

Refined robot kit and software based on pilot feedback.

Initial community engagement metrics (number of active students, projects submitted).

First student-led projects and challenges completed.

Phase 3: Expansion (9–18 months)

Goal: Grow reach, partnerships, and structured programs.

Key Actions

Partnerships

Partner with 5–10 additional schools or STEM centers.

Engage with local NGOs, government STEM programs, and sponsors for support.

Community Growth

Launch online collaboration hub for students to share projects and resources.

Recruit mentors (older students, alumni, volunteers).

Program Scaling

Organize regional competitions with prizes to motivate students.

Increase kit production (50–100 kits) with local partners.

Incubation Preparation

Identify top student projects suitable for incubation.

Develop playbooks and guidelines for future startups.

Outputs

Active network of schools and students.

Regional competitions completed with measurable participation.

Pipeline of student-led projects for incubation.

Phase 4: Sustainability & Scale (18–36 months)

Goal: Establish Project Continuum as a sustainable, recognized African STEM program.

Key Actions

Hardware & Software

Scale kit production to serve dozens of schools.

Continuously update firmware and simulator based on feedback.

Community & Mentorship

Build mentorship network connecting students with tech professionals.

Launch training academies and advanced workshops.

Events & Competitions

Host national or regional showcases for student innovations.

Introduce advanced challenges integrating AI, robotics, and STEM solutions.

Funding & Sustainability

Secure grants, sponsorships, and donations for long-term operations.

Support student-led startups through incubation, mentorship, and seed funding.

Outputs

Self-sustaining ecosystem of schools, students, and mentors.

Multiple regional competitions and showcases.

Recognized pipeline of African STEM innovators and student startups.
